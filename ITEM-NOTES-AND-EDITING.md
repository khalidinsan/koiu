# Item Notes and Order Editing Features

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of two major features:

1. **Item Notes** - Ability to add custom notes to each order item (e.g., "less sugar", "extra hot")
2. **Order Editing** - Ability to edit order items for orders that are not completed

## 1. Database Changes

### Migration Required
Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Migration: Add item notes to order items
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor

-- Add item_notes column to order_items table
ALTER TABLE order_items 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS item_notes TEXT;

-- Test the migration
SELECT 'Item notes column added successfully!' as status;
```

### Updated Schema
The `order_items` table now includes:
- `item_notes` (TEXT, nullable) - Custom notes for each item

## 2. Customer Interface Features

### 2.1 Item Notes on Main Page (src/app/page.tsx)
- **Add to Cart Modal**: When customers click "Add to Cart", a modal opens allowing them to add notes
- **Notes Input**: Simple text input with placeholder "e.g., less sugar, extra hot, no whip cream..."
- **Cart Management**: Notes are preserved when items are added to cart
- **Same Items with Different Notes**: Treated as separate cart entries

### 2.2 Item Notes in Checkout (src/app/checkout/page.tsx)
- **Item Notes Display**: Each cart item shows an input field for notes
- **Real-time Updates**: Notes can be edited during checkout
- **Order Submission**: Notes are included when creating orders

### Key Functions Added:
- `updateItemNotes()` - Updates notes for specific cart items
- Modified `addToCart()` - Handles items with notes as separate entries
- Enhanced order submission to include `itemNotes` field

## 3. Admin Interface Features

### 3.1 Manual Order Creation
- **Item Notes Field**: Each manual order item includes notes input
- **Interface**: Clean input field with placeholder text
- **Validation**: Notes are optional but preserved when provided

### 3.2 Order Editing for Non-Completed Orders
- **Edit Button**: Available for orders with status other than "completed"
- **Full Order Edit**: Edit customer info, items, quantities, notes, and additional fees
- **Status Restriction**: Completed orders cannot be edited (shows error message)

### 3.3 Order Details Modal
- **Item Notes Display**: Shows item notes in blue text below each item
- **Format**: "Note: {item_notes}" when notes exist

### 3.4 Receipt Generation
- **Item Notes Included**: Receipts display item notes for each item
- **Formatting**: Notes appear below item names
- **Export Formats**: Notes included in PDF, image, and print formats

## 4. API Updates

### 4.1 Customer API (src/app/api/orders/route.ts)
**Changes:**
- Added `itemNotes` to OrderItem interface
- Updated order creation to save item notes
- Enhanced data validation

### 4.2 Admin API (src/app/api/admin/orders/route.ts)
**Changes:**
- Updated GET to include `item_notes` in order items query
- Enhanced POST to handle item notes in manual orders
- Updated PUT to support full order editing with notes
- Added validation for completed order editing restrictions

**Key Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/admin/orders` - Returns orders with item notes
- `POST /api/admin/orders` - Creates orders with item notes
- `PUT /api/admin/orders` - Updates orders (restricted for completed orders)

## 5. TypeScript Interfaces

### Updated Interfaces:
```typescript
interface OrderItem {
  id: string;
  coffee_name: string;
  variant_size: string;
  variant_id: string;
